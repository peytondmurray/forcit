# FORCIT

This repository is a copy of the FORCIT analysis software originally written by
Gary Acton, and hosted on the [UC Davis paleomag group
website](http://paleomag.ucdavis.edu/software-forcit.html). That site has long
since gone down, and I've taken the opportunity to pull the source from the
Wayback Machine and mirror it here.

See `Readme.txt` for the original instructions to compile and use FORCIT.

For a modern alternative to FORCIT, see
[pyforc](https://github.com/peytondmurray/pyforc), a FORC analysis tool written
in Python.
